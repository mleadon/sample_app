><Executive_Summary
>A MEA based co-culture system has been developed to model electrical signal propagation at graft host interface.  However, the ultimate utility of the system for regenerative medicine may be limited by the apparent signal:noise constraints of the system. 70% cardiac purity is required for activation of a single electrode on the array.  The system appears more useful for measuring signal propagation, or perhaps more accurately, signal decay across a high to low cardiac purity interface.&#xD;&#xD;The majority of measurements presented by the investigators have involved HL-1 cells (chick atrial cells) as the signal (“host”) source and differentiating hESC or percoll purified hESC-CM as the graft.  Chick heart rate is approximately 400bpm and human is approximately 60.  While this ensures an electrical signaling discrepancy between the populations, it’s impossible to determine the effect that hESC-CM grafts might have on a more closely matched host.  The observed differences could be either species or purity related.  Therefore from a therapeutic perspective, the ideal test of the system’s performance would be with better matched human cardiac populations such as human fetal cardiac myocytes-hESC-CM and human adult cardiac myocytes-hESC-CM.   It would also be of interest to determine if results of the system are predictive of those in large animal models that closely match human heart rates.&#xD;&#xD;Using the system, the PI has found that pacing can increase conduction homogeneity of hESC-CM and will pursue this with Dr. Irv Weissman’s group.  This could have therapeutic relevance as it could be used as a tool to mature hESC-CM grafts.&#xD;</Executive_Summary
