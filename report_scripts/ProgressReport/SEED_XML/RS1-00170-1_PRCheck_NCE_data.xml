>RS1-00170-1 (UCSC, Dr. Bin Chen)//Evaluation by SO – NCE Year&#xD;In this grant, Dr Chen proposed to develop methods to differentiate hESCs into corticospinal motor neurons (CSMNs), and determine whether they can form functional neural circuits in vivo. &#xD;The timeline for a starting investigator in an institution new to hESC work was, in my opinion, pretty ambitious.&#xD;Aim 1: Identify a reliable marker/markers for human CMNs.&#xD;During last interim progress report, the PI reports that for the N-terminal recombinant protein, they achieved purification and received the final bleed of the serum that they are testing for the presence of Fezl-specific antibodies. This was May 2009. They tested it on WB and some batches gave a band. It was useless in ICC. Because of that lack of Fezl-specific antibody that works in immunostaining, they decided mark the hESCs-derived neurons with Fezl-GFP, which contains a GFP gene under the control of the endogenous Fezl promoter. When hESCs are differentiated into CSMNs, they should be able to detect Fezl expression by RT-PCR, and the GFP expression from the transgene will allow labeling the cell bodies and axons of the hESCs-derived CSMNs. This is an artificial marker that will have more limited applications than the initial aim. &#xD;Aim2: Differentiate hESCs into CSMNs in vitro. &#xD;They find a mixed cell population. In order to enrich for cortical neural progenitor cells, they have decided to mark the cortical progenitor cells with GFP, using BAC transgenic technology.&#xD;In the last year they were unable to establish an hESC line containing Fezl-EGFP transgene yet. &#xD;They have, however, obtained the Fezl-GFP knock-in clone from Dr.Zheng’s group. Upon neural induction, GFP expression was detected. They are currently using this HUES-9 Fezl-GFP knock-in line for transplantation.&#xD;Aim 3: Test whether CSMNs generated from cultured hESCs in vitro can form functional neural circuits in vivo. &#xD;They started this aim in the NCE period. They are currently optimizing the transplantation condition and have just started transplanting hESC-derived neural progenitor cells into P0 mouse brains.&#xD;Overall, the made progress but did not finish any of the aims. –Useful feedback for PI (already conveyed before) would be to add more personnel to this project. (concern in other two progress reports).&#xD;SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS IS APPROVED.&#xD;</Executive_Summary
