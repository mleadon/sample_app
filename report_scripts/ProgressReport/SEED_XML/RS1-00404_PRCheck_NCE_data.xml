During a phone call, the PI clarified that the mouse work was mentioned for future directions, it was not part of this grant's research, and no SEED grant funds were spent on the mouse work. Therefore, no IACUC was required.</Science_Officer_Notes

><Executive_Summary
>The original goal of this SEED grant was to work out the derivation of patient-specific hESC using SCNT. Once iPSC technology had been invented, the original PI on this grant switched to that technology, and the remainder of this grant, after year 1, was transferred to Aaron Hsueh. The goal of the second year of research was to continue attempts toward human SCNT using readily accessible failed to fertilize human oocytes, rejected from reproductive IVF procedures, as recipient cells for somatic nuclei. After establishing a vitrification procedure to cryopreserve oocytes, recovered oocytes were enucleated and used for transfer of nuclei from human fibroblasts arrested in G1/G0 by serum starvation. The reconstructed embryos were cultured in the absence or presence of growth factors that had been identified as embryonic autocrine factors. Overall, 1/34 vitrified oocytes developed into a SCNT embryo with more than 4 cells in the absence of growth factors, whereas 6/29 did so in the presence of growth factors. Under the latter condition, one embryo developed to the 16 cell stage, but none of its blastomeres, when cultured individually, survived. Importantly, none of the putative SCNT embryos were genetically verified to be successful nuclear transfers.&#xD;&#xD;An alternate readily available source of human oocytes are those that are polyspermic. The PI used 12 such oocytes for SCNT, and one resulting embryo cleaved once. To further develop the protocol for use of in vitro matured immature human oocytes, parthenogenetic activation of such oocytes was performed, followed by unsuccessful attempts to derive hESC from the resulting blastocysts. Overall, the PI concluded that oocytes retrieved for IVF, but unfit for reproductive purposes, are not a viable source of oocytes for SCNT. In future research, he will focus on another potential source of oocytes, the in vitro activation of primordial follicles from ovarian cortical fragments removed from cancer patients.&#xD;&#xD;</Executive_Summary
