><Executive_Summary
>This project has been underway for three years and has just completed a 1-year no-cost extension. &#xD;Aim 1- In  this NCE year they planned to carry out dose-response studies and screen a library of approx 300 compounds, follow up with preparation of hits in quantity and verification finally submitting a manuscript.  (4 months) &#xD;Aim 1.2- Screen hit compounds in combination with sm inhibitor of GSK3-beta. &#xD;Aim 1.3- Prepare asterriquinones in sufficient quantities (1 month) in order to proof ability to replace neurrotrophins in the survival of hESC lines. &#xD;Aim 1.4- Also dependent on Aim 1.1. (1 month).&#xD;Despite changing the hESC line to H9 (from a more expert neighboring lab), solving the problem with feeder cells,  they failed to establish a clonal survival assay and therefore all other subaims from Aim 1 were not achieved (all activities depended on step Aim 1.1).&#xD;&#xD;Aim 2. Discover N-(heteroarylsulfamoyl)-phenyl cinnamides (aka cinnamides) that promote&#xD;differentiation of hESCs to dopaminergic neurons.&#xD;During Year 1 progress report claimed to have prepared 32 compounds (cinnamides) of the 120 total that they planned to have in their library.  In 1 year, they  synthesized up to 72 compounds. (40 compounds in 1 year).  They screened the library and identified 8 compounds that they claim exhibit the property of differentiation hESC-derived neural rosettes into DA neurons. Phamacophore was identified through evaluation of structures. &#xD;One of the most potent representative of the actives was prepared in 100 mg quantities and characterized. They called this compound DANDI. During the NCE year they have attempted to show that the hESC derived cells are DA neurons. They've done that through morphology (not very convincing as it could be many types of neuronally derived cells or even neuroblastoma type cell line), RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry (only TH and tubulin) and FACS. No functional assays performed. Bearing in mind this is a chemistry lab, they indeed achieved a substantial progress through this SEED grant in getting familiar with hESC research. The standards of characterization are not up to the level that we would consider appropriate for demonstration that the hESC derived cells with their DANDI compound are indeed DA neurons, however, if this work proceeds, I would suggest to make a collaboration with a hESC lab and test the compound in different hESC lines and iPSC lines. </Executive_Summary

>The team has achieved Aim 2 (to a 80%, I would say) and produced a small molecule that differentiates 1 hESC line into some sort of DA neuronal derivative. Further characterization is required but is a good start. </Outcomes
