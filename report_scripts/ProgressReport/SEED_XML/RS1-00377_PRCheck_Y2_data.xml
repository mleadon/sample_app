>&#xD;&#xD;YEAR 2 PROGRESS&#xD;Overall, progress has been steady and in the direction of the proposed aims.  PI anticipates to be done by grant closeout. &#xD;&#xD;Aim 1A:  Using new stem cell lines and optimized culture conditions, the lab replicated the finding that immunosuppressand drugs alter NSC fate for both fetal and embryonic cells (data not shown!).  They show data supporting the conclusion that fetal and embryonic NSCs have different differentiation capacity (more GFAP in fetal NSCs less beta tubulin).  This year, they also studied the effect of immunosuppressive drugs on cell death and proliferation assays: rapamycin had an anti-proliferative effect on fetal-derived NSCs, and they are completing studies on cell death at different time points after IS addition.  Progress seems a little slow.&#xD;&#xD;Aim 1B:  Looking at the effects of PMN- and macrophage-conditioned media on the differentiation of fetal and embryonic NSCs.  In fetal-derived cells, MAC-CM promoted beta-tubulin expression, PMN-CM promoted GFAP expression, both reduced the number of oligos.  The effects on ES-derived NSCs were different.&#xD;Towards this aim, the lab also did experiments to look at the effect of oxidative stress on NSCs.  They tested the ability of ROS scavengers (SOD1, catalase) to prevent oxidative stress-induced cell damage and death.  H2O2 death of ES-NSCs was prevented by treatment with catalase but not SOD1.  H2O2 more effectively promoted cell death in ES cells as compared to fetal cells.&#xD;In other experiments, the lab showed that PMN-CM differentially affected proliferation of fetal and ES-derived NSCS.  PMN-CM reduces proliferation of fetal NSCs (by BrdU labeling), whereas it has no effect on ES-NSC proliferation.  &#xD;These experiments suggest that there are substantial differences between NSCs derived from fetal and ES sources.  &#xD;&#xD;Aim 2 (this is the new Aim): In these experiments, the PI examines the effect of IS drugs on engraftment and differentiation of NSCs  in vivo.  To eliminate the effects of xenorejection, he does these experiments in SOD mice.  No significant differences were observed in any of the assays.&#xD;</Executive_Summary
