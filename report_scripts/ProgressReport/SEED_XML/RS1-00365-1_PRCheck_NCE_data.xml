><Executive_Summary
>&#xD;SUMMARY:&#xD;The goal of the present research proposal is to elucidate patterns of glycoprotein expression and biosynthesis to identify stage-specific markers during neuronal differentiation. Detailed information about the molecular structures of the glycoforms present on stem cells before and during differentiation, however, is not yet been available. This has in part been due to the lack of effective tools for visualizing, sequencing and profiling glycoproteins â€“ a situation which has been recently remedied by techniques developed in our lab and others. &#xD;SO: The plans for this present year were very ambitious. Still, the results of last year brought clarity to the fact that while azidosugars have been incorporated into several different cell types, they did not know whether hESCs could metabolically incorporate azidosugars and this research brought light into this.  &#xD;In the past year, they continued their analysis of the glycoproteins, glycans and associated glyco-genes present on undifferentiated hESCs and at various stages of neuronal development. In collaboration with Prof. Lebrilla at UC Davis they have optimized a technique to identify glycans using state-of-the art mass spectrometry (MS) and complementary analytical techniques. The structural analyses obtained resulted in the discovery of a particularly interesting class of glycans (high mannose N-linked glycans) present on the cell surfaces during differentiation to neurons.&#xD;&#xD;Scientific Progress is Approved. &#xD;</Executive_Summary
